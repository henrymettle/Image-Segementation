Brain Tumor and Heart Failure Segmentation using U-Net Architecture
This project focuses on the segmentation of brain tumors and heart failure regions using the U-Net architecture. The U-Net model is widely recognized for its effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks, particularly due to its ability to perform precise localization and classification of regions of interest in biomedical images.

Introduction
The accurate segmentation of brain tumors and heart failure regions in medical images is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. This project leverages the U-Net architecture to segment these regions in MRI scans for brain tumors and cardiac images for heart failure. The U-Net model's encoder-decoder structure enables detailed segmentation by capturing both low-level and high-level features.

Model Architecture
U-Net:
The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path (encoder) to capture context and a symmetric expanding path (decoder) for precise localization.
Skip connections between the encoder and decoder layers ensure that fine-grained details are preserved, leading to accurate segmentation results.

Dataset
This project uses publicly available datasets for brain tumor and heart failure segmentation. E
Training
Training scripts are provided for both brain tumor and heart failure segmentation.
Model checkpoints are saved in the models/ directory after each epoch.
